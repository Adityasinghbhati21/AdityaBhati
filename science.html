<h1>3. Impact of Satellites</h1>
<p>A. Weather Prediction
Purpose: Satellites like INSAT and Cartosat monitor weather conditions and provide data for accurate forecasts.
Impact: Help predict storms, cyclones, and monsoons, enabling better preparedness and disaster response.</p>

<p>B. Navigation
Purpose: NAVIC provides precise location data for transportation and navigation.
Impact: Improves traffic management, safety in aviation, and maritime navigation.</p>

<p>C. Disaster Management
Purpose: Satellites help monitor natural disasters like cyclones, floods, and earthquakes.
Impact: They provide real-time data for rescue operations, helping save lives during disasters.</p>

<h1>4. Conclusion</h1>
<p>India’s satellite technology is rapidly advancing, with projects like Gaganyaan (human spaceflight) in the pipeline. India’s contributions benefit not only its people but also the global space community.</p>
